## Disclaimer: Github Workflow Limitations

These workflows are intended to save folks time and complexity in getting up and running with Nx Cloud and Github Actions. They are _NOT_ intended to be a one-size-fits-all CI solution.

They will scale to workspaces of essentially any size thanks to the way they can distribute and parallelize tasks, however, that does not mean that they are infinitely configurable.

The workflows found here leverage a relatively new feature of Github called reusable workflows: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows

The extensibility of these Nx Cloud workflows is therefore strictly bound by the capabilities of the Github feature.

This means that you cannot do things such as embed additional Github actions within the workflow, or majorly customize the steps we have set up for you.

If you find yourself needing to customize things beyond what is supported by Github reusable workflows, then the best way is to simply take a look at the source of the workflows within this repo [./.github/workflows](./.github/workflows) and use that as your starting point directly within your configs.

> NOTE: Another really important limitation of these reusable Github workflows is that you are not allowed to pass data from the special `${{ secrets }}` namespace into the workflow you are invoking (i.e. `nrwl/ci`). If you find yourself needing to use secret values beyond the small number we have explicitly built support for, you will again need to use this project as inspiration, rather than using it directly.

## Example Usage

The following will configure a CI workflow that runs on the `main` branch, and on all pull requests into the `main` branch. The CI workflow will do the following:

- Checkout your repo at the appropriate depth for determining affected projects
- Determine the `head` and `base` SHAs to use for `nx affected`
- Install nodejs
- Use an appropriate node_module caching strategy for either `yarn`, `npm` or `pnpm` (depending on which one is configured in your repo)
- Install locked dependencies with either `yarn`, `npm` or `pnpm` (depending on which one is configured in your repo)
- Spawn 3 agents ready to receive tasks/targets to run
- Initiate all the provided commands in parallel, with those defined in `parallel-commands` being executed on the main job, and those in `parallel-commands-on-agents` being intelligently distributed across the 3 agents by Nx Cloud
- Shut down all agents when all parallel tasks have been completed

## Limited Secrets Support

As noted above, it is not possible to generically forward values from the special `${{ secrets }}` namespace into this workflow, because of the limitations of Github reusable workflows.

Nevertheless, we have set up some explicit handling for the most common secret values that folks would need in the simple CI setups that this workflow is intended to support.

For example, the main and agent workflows both support passing `NX_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN` and `NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN` from the parent workflow. These secrets are still kept encrypted and the `main` workflow will only use the `NX_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN` and `NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN` if those are defined.

**.github/workflows/ci.yml**

<!-- start example-usage -->

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  main:
    name: Nx Cloud - Main Job
    uses: nrwl/ci/.github/workflows/nx-cloud-main.yml@v0.11
    secrets:
      NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
      NX_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NX_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN }}
    with: ...

  agents:
    name: Nx Cloud - Agents
    uses: nrwl/ci/.github/workflows/nx-cloud-agents.yml@v0.11
    secrets:
      NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
      NX_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NX_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN }}
    with: ...
```

See the annotated configuration below for all explicitly supported secret values.
